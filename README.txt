PLEASE USE THE STEPS BELOW TO HELP CREATE YOUR DOC

1. please go into 0_title_pages.tex and add your information to the variables at the top of the page
    -- this includes your document type, degree, program name, paper title, name, graduation year, and academic unit
    -- navigate to the second section and add your committee members (alter section beginning at line 81) to match the information provided here in the second section
    -- NOTE: NOTHING ELSE IN THIS DOC SHOULD BE CHANGED UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING TO EDIT THE TEMPLATE ITSELF

2. add your desired text to the respective files, which include:
    -- 1_acknowledgments.tex --> acknowledgments **
    -- 2_abstract.tex --> abstract **
    -- *.tex --> your custom chapters for your doc
        -- these can be renamed to whatever your chapters may be called although it is NOT recommended and would require changes to main.tex where these files are imported into the final document
            -- comment out information in chapters that you will NOT use (see 7_other.tex for example)

3. for exmaples of inserting tables, equations, and figures, see 5_results.tex

4. this template uses the American Meteorological Society format for the bibliography (ametsocV6.bst)
    -- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO USE THIS FORMAT
    -- there is no standard for the OU Graduate College on formatting, so you are free to use this 
    -- you can add your own formatting document if desired, but a .bst format is ideal due to the bibtex/biblatex formatting used in this document
